  dialogue:
  - Ok so, my first name "Blue" is one of the three primary colours in the RYB colour
    model, as well as in the RGB colour model. It lies between violet and cyan on
    the spectrum of visible light.
  - 'My second name "Nigga" : In the English language, the word nigger is a racial
    slur used against black people, especially African Americans. '
  - Starting in the 1980s, references to nigger have been progressively replaced
    by the euphemism "the N-word", notably in cases where nigger is mentioned but
    not directly used.
